Odin Project Recipe Book

This is the first milestone I am completing in the odin project.
In this lesson I am creating a cookbook using simple HTML elements,
which shouldn't be too difficult.

The main reason I am following this section of the course is to learn
git and github better, as they are very important tools for a 
professional developer.

After the lesson I hope to have a more solid understanding of git
